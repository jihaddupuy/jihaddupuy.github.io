                <Article>
                    I am a 25 year old software developer from Cleveland Ohio I've always had an interest in technology, I found that my path to it was a bit unique. At a young age I found it was good by solving the first side of a rubik's cube. thanks to my upbringing I spent the first 15 years of my life working in carpentry with my father learning the trade and The following five years working on cars learning that trade with these two skills under my belt I learned an immense amount of technical skills and problem solving that I still use today I had entered the workforce at eighteen,young but eager to be Self-sufficient i started  working at University Hospitals it was there I learned the skills to have a customer service driven attitude but it was by far my favorite job because of the people I got to meet and it gave me the drive 
                    wanted to stand out and be above-average. That job has led me on my path to where i am  today It took seven years in the making but my drive and passion is still the same.
