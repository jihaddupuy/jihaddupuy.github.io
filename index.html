                     <Article>
                        Hello Welcome to my page, I am a 25 year old software developer from Cleveland Ohio, I've always had an interest in technology. I found that my path to it was a bit unique. I spent the first 15 years of my life working in carpentry with my father learning the trade. The following five years working on cars learning that trade. With these two skills under my belt I learned an immense amount of technical skills and problem solving that I still use today. I entered the workforce at eighteen, young but eager to be Self-sufficient I started working at University Hospitals. It was there I learned the skills to have a customer service driven attitude. It was by far my favorite job because of the people I got to meet. After 2 years of working there and getting to know many Career Doctors And Nurses, I found the drive to stand out and be above-average. That experience has led me to where I am today. It took seven years in the making but my drive and passion are still the same.

                           <p>In this project I was tasked with creating any class I wanted. I created my own properties, methods, and constructors to make a simulation that showcases different attributes between cars and SUVs. The car class and SUV clash. Each have their own unique takes throughout the simulation. It is up to the end user to choose wisely to make the vehicle function as long as possible.</p>
