                     <Article>
                        I am a 25 year old software developer from Cleveland Ohio, I've always had an interest in technology I found that my path to it was a bit unique. At a young age I found out I was good at problem solving By solving the first side of a rubik's cube. Thanks to my upbringing I spent the first 15 years of my life working in carpentry with my father learning the trade and The following five years working on cars learning that trade with these two skills under my belt I learned an immense amount of technical skills and problem solving that I still use today. I entered the workforce at eighteen, young but eager to be Self-sufficient I started working at University Hospitals, it was there I learned the skills to have a customer service driven attitude.
                         It was by far my favorite job because of the people I got to meet. After 2 years of working there and getting to know  many Career Doctors And Nusres I found the drive to stand out
                         and be above-average. that experience has led me to where I am today it took seven years in the making but my drive and passion is still the same.
